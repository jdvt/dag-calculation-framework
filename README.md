## Calculation frameworks 

Numerical calculations can be defined in a graphical formats. 

This has the following advantages 
*Feature* Calculations are self documenting: the code is the document and vice versa
*Benefit* Calculations can be easily understood, documentation is readily available 

*Feature* Calculations themselves are defined in code 
*Benefit* Each variable can be changed to allow for sensitivity analysis (variables are abstracted from formula)


###Â Functionality

Network defined in pygraphviz 
-- attributes given to nodes and edges 

Reduction / calculation is completed in networkx 
- Check on if inputs are inputs 

Plotting is completed in pygraphviz
- Plotting functionality is independent of calculation... But this could change..
