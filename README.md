## Calculation frameworks 

Numerical calculations are be defined in a graphical formats. 

This has the following advantages 
- Calculations are self documenting: the code is the document and vice versa
    - As calculations are created, documents are made and so calculations can be easily understood
- Calculations themselves are defined in code -- variables are abstracted from formula
    - Each variable can be change to allow for sensitivity analysis
